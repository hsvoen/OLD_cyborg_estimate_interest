# Trollnode
ROS package for communicating with the trollface over TCP.

The Trollnode is made for [ROS Hydro](http://wiki.ros.org/hydro) on Ubuntu 12.04, and probably won't work on other setups. It is written in C++03, as that's what ROS Hydro uses, and trying to use something newer would most likely lead to compatibility problems or mess up Catkin. Use catkin_make to build it.

# Using the Trollface

Do note that this code does not actually include the trollface, and is only a ROS TCP client for sending messages containing expressions to the Trollface. 

# Setting Facial Expressions, TTS and looking direction

# Examples
Greeting, publish expression and look.
